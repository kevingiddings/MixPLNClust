pi is a vector of length 2. What proportion of rows are in cluster 1 and 2 respectively.
mu is a list of 2 vectors. Mu values for the 2 clusters, respectively.
Sigma is a list of 2 matrices. Covaraince matrix values for the 2 clusters, respectively.}

\description{
This dataset was simulated using a mixture of two Poisson log-normal distributions.
Missing values were chosen based on the \code{\link[mice]{ampute}} function from
the \pkg{mice} package. We chose a missing proportion of 0.30 and missing
not at random for the mechanism. We had a custom set of patterns enforcing
each row have at least 2 observations.
